# MURFI-user-manual

This manual describes the use of MURFI software to deliver real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-nf).

MURFI (multivariate and univariate real-time functional imaging) is a software package for real-time processing of functional brain images for neuroscience applications.

rt-fMRI-nf is a type of biofeedback in which real-time online fMRI signals are used to self-regulate brain (neuro) function. Since it's advent in 1995 significant progress has been made in fMRI neurofeedback techniques. Specifically, the use of rt-fMRI-nf has advanced the understanding of causal involvement of modified brain activity in modified behavior. rt-fMRI-nf was developed in 1995 (Cox et al., 1995), and proof-of concept for rt-fMRI-nf as a potential neurotherapeutic tool for the treatment of brain disorders was demonstrated in 2005 (deCharms et al., 2005). There have since been substantial advancements related to rt-fMRI-nf technology and implementation, with reports of rt-fMRI-nf modification of function in several brain structures. Although rt-fMRI-nf has multiple potential applications as a clinical neuroimaging tool, the research to date has been focused on the use of rt-fMRI-nf to alter brain function and behavior.
